## What is Hookory?

**Hookory** is an intelligent content repurposing engine designed for professionals, founders, and creators who want to build a personal brand on LinkedIn but don't have hours to spend writing from scratch.

Instead of staring at a blank page, Hookory allows you to take existing long-form content—like a blog post, news article, or a rough draft—and instantly transform it into a polished, high-engagement LinkedIn post tailored to your unique voice.

It’s not just a summarizer; it’s a strategic writing partner that understands the nuances of social media engagement.

## How It Works: The Simplified Workflow

Creating high-quality content with Hookory is a streamlined, three-step process:

### 1. **Input Your Source**
You don't need to write new ideas to post new content.
*   **Paste a URL**: Have a great blog post or saw an interesting industry article? Just paste the link. Hookory reads the content directly.
*   **Paste Text**: Have some rough notes, a partial draft, or a transcript? Paste the raw text directly into the editor.

### 2. **Set Context & Angle**
We stripped away complex settings. Just tell Hookory three things:
*   **Who is it for?** (Reader Context): Peers, Learners, Decision-makers, or General Audience. You can even type a custom audience.
*   **What is the focus?** (Angle): Should the post focus on a "Common Mistake", a "Lesson Learned", or a "Strong Opinion"? Hookory will ignore fluff and focus entirely on your chosen angle.
*   **Tone & Style**: Choose from Professional, Conversational, or Bold. Toggle Emojis on or off.

### 3. **Generate & Publish**
Select your desired output format (Main Post, Story, Carousel, or Hook) and generate.
In seconds, you get a fully formatted LinkedIn post ready for the feed:
*   **The Hook**: Every post starts with a scroll-stopping first line.
*   **The Body**: Clean, punchy sentences with mobile-optimized line breaks.
*   **Alternative Hooks**: Every generation includes **5 bonus hooks** at the bottom so you can A/B test your opening line.

## Intelligent Output Formats

Hookory offers specialized writing modes to match different content strategies:

### 📝 Main Post
*Best for: Daily updates and thought leadership.*
A balanced, high-performing LinkedIn structure. It delivers one clear insight supported by strong reasoning, ending with a reflective takeaway.
*   **Structure**: Strong Hook → Clear Insight → Supporting Points → Discussion CTA.

### 📖 Story Post
*Best for: Building connection and trust.*
Humans connect with stories, not just facts. This mode transforms dry experiences into a narrative arc, focusing on a specific struggle, a turning point, and a valuable lesson learned.
*   **Structure**: The Struggle → The Realization → The Transformation → The Lesson.

### 🎠 Carousel Text
*Best for: Teaching complex topics.*
Perfect for breaking down "How-to" guides or listicles. This mode generates slide-by-slide text that you can copy directly into a PDF or image carousel design.
*   **Structure**: Slide 1 (Title) → Slides 2-5 (One tip per slide) → Final Slide (Summary).

### ⚡ Short Viral Hook
*Best for: Maximum reach and readability.*
Minimalist and punchy. This mode strips away all explanations and focuses entirely on the impact. Great for quick tips or sharp observations that people want to repost.
*   **Structure**: Single sharp insight → Broken lines → Fast pacing.

## Why Choose Hookory?

### ✅ Angle-First Intelligence
Most AI tools just summarize. Hookory's new engine focuses on your chosen **Angle**. If you select "Common Mistake", it will read your entire blog post solely to find and highlight the mistakes, ignoring everything else. This creates posts that feel opinionated and human.

### ✅ Stop Writing From Scratch
The hardest part of writing is the blank page. Hookory gives you a 90% complete draft in seconds, so you only spend time on the final 10% of personal polish.

### ✅ Consistency is Key
Growth on LinkedIn requires showing up every day. By repurposing one blog post into 3-4 different LinkedIn posts (a story, a thought piece, a carousel), you can plan a week's worth of content in minutes.
