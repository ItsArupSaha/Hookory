**Turn Blogs into Viral LinkedIn Posts in Seconds.**

## What is Hookory?

**Hookory** is a creator-grade content repurposing engine for professionals, founders, and creators who want to build a personal brand on LinkedIn without spending hours writing from scratch.

Unlike generic AI summarizers, Hookory transforms source content into **opinionated, scroll-stopping posts** with real conviction and human-like voice. Every output is designed to make readers stop, think, and engage.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Input Your Source**
- **Paste a URL**: Blog post, news article, research paper—just paste the link.
- **Paste Text**: Raw notes, transcripts, or partial drafts work too.

### 2. **Set Context & Angle**
- **Who is it for?** (Reader Context): Peers, Learners, Decision-makers, or custom audience.
- **What is the focus?** (Angle): "Common Mistake", "Lesson Learned", or "Strong Opinion".
- **Tone & Style**: Professional, Conversational, or Bold. Emojis on/off.

### 3. **Generate & Publish**
Select your output format and get a fully polished LinkedIn post in seconds:
- **The Hook**: Scroll-stopping first line with conviction.
- **The Body**: Clean, punchy sentences with mobile-optimized formatting.
- **5 Bonus Hooks**: A/B test your opening line.

## Output Formats

### 📝 Main Post (Insight-First)
*Best for: Daily updates and thought leadership.*

**DNA**: "Here's what I learned: [claim]. Here's why: [evidence]."

Opens with a bold claim, backs it up with source details, includes a hard trade-off or uncomfortable truth, and ends with a new perspective.

---

### 📖 Story Post (Protagonist-First)
*Best for: Building connection and trust.*

**DNA**: "[Person] was stuck. Then [event]. Now [outcome]."

Features a real protagonist (not "most people"), a specific struggle with sensory details, a turning point, and a resolution. Every story passes the "movie scene" test—if you can't visualize it, it's too abstract.

---

### 🎠 Carousel (Revelation Arc)
*Best for: Teaching complex topics with swipe urgency.*

**DNA**: "You think X. But actually Y. Here's what changes."

Each slide creates an incomplete thought that forces the swipe. No listicle energy. No predictable "Problem → Solution" patterns. Every slide ends with a cliffhanger.

---

### ⚡ Short Viral Hook (Punch-First)
*Best for: Maximum reach and impact.*

**DNA**: "[Sharp claim]. [One sentence of evidence]. [Challenge]."

The sharpest possible opening. Minimal words. Maximum punch. Think tweet energy, LinkedIn packaging.

## What Makes Hookory Different

### ✅ Conviction Injection
Every post contains at least one of:
- A **contrarian claim**: "Most people misunderstand X."
- A **bold prediction**: "This will be obsolete in 2 years."
- An **uncomfortable truth**: "Nobody tells you this, but..."
- A **polarizing stance**: "I'd rather X than Y."

If a reasonable person couldn't disagree with your main claim, it's too weak.

---

### ✅ Stat Integrity (Zero Tolerance)
- **Never invents statistics.** Only uses numbers explicitly in the source.
- Instead of fake percentages, uses qualitative anchors: "I've seen this fail firsthand."

---

### ✅ Emotional Anchoring
- No generic "I struggled" or "It was hard."
- Every story includes a **specific moment** you can visualize like a movie scene.
- Uses verbs like "flinched", "hesitated", "froze", "realized at 2AM".

---

### ✅ Disagreement-Inviting CTAs
No more "What steps are you taking?" or "Are you ready?"

Instead:
- **Hot Take Challenge**: "Change my mind: X is overrated."
- **Confession Prompt**: "What's the worst mistake you made doing X?"
- **Polarizing Either/Or**: "Would you rather lose your audience or your integrity?"

If the CTA can be answered in under 5 words, it's too weak.
